## Introduction
The SONAR dataset is used to differentiate between rocks and mines based on sonar returns. The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model that can accurately classify these objects.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- 
## Usage
1. To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sajjal-4/SONAR_Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.git
 ```
2. Change your directory to the project folder:
   cd SONAR_Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook SONAR_Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction_via_Logistic_Regression.ipynb
 ```
